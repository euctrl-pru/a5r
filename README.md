**a5r** provides R bindings for the [A5](https://a5geo.org/) pentagonal Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS).

A5 is a hierarchical geospatial indexing system that partitions the Earth's surface into pentagonal cells. Unlike hexagonal systems like H3, A5 uses pentagons which tile the sphere without requiring special irregular cells.

## Features
 
- Convert between coordinates and cell IDs
- Navigate the cell hierarchy (parent/children)
- Compact and uncompact cell sets
- Get cell boundaries and areas
- Fast Rust implementation via [extendr](https://extendr.github.io/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of a5r from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("euctrl-pru/a5r")
```
 
**Note:** Building from source requires Rust. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Example

```r
library(a5r)

# Convert coordinates to a cell at resolution 5
cell <- lon_lat_to_cell(lon = 4.4, lat = 52.0, resolution = 5)

# Get the cell as hex string
u64_to_hex(cell)
#> [1] "63da000000000000"

# Get cell center
cell_to_lon_lat(cell)
#> $lon
#> [1] 4.397673
#> $lat
#> [1] 52.00187

# Get cell resolution
get_resolution(cell)
#> [1] 5

# Navigate hierarchy
parent <- cell_to_parent(cell, NULL)
children <- cell_to_children(cell, NULL)

# Compact children back to parent
compact(children)
```

## Grid Properties

A5 has some unique characteristics:

- **12 base cells** at resolution 0 (pentagons on a dodecahedron)
- **4 children per cell** at most resolutions (5 at resolution 0→1)
- **Cell area** decreases ~4x per resolution level
- **Resolution range**: 0 to 30

```r
# Get all base cells
get_res0_cells()

# Get cell count at resolution 5
get_num_cells(5)
#> [1] 15360

# Get cell area in square meters
get_cell_area(10)
#> [1] 33201823
```

## Todo's
Big inspiration from the [`h3o` R package](https://extendr.rs/h3o/index.html):
[ ] make `a5r` work with the {sf} package for geometric operations.
    Mimick the [`h3_from_points` et Co.](https://extendr.rs/h3o/reference/H3.html)
[ ] define the A5 class as {vctrs}, to make it work seamlessly within
    a tidyverse workflow
